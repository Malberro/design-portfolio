        <h1>A bit about me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Venezuela and moved to the United States when I was 5-years-old. From walking down city blocks lined with locals selling arepas, to driving down the New Jersey turnpike for the first timne, it was an adjustment. I remember arring at Newark airport unable to process the cold weather. What is this strange sensation?</p>
        <p>However, adapting to a new culture and learning to speak English has led me to be curious about the rest of the world. What I find most rewarding is observing another country's design aesthetic. How does their stop sign differentiate from the one back home? What colors and shapes do they use for their buildings? Why are their storefronts decorated that way? What is their design and why?</p>

          <h1>Before Design</h1>
          <p>For the last 7 years, I've been a project manager at Penguin Random House. In order to be successful in this role, one must be well-organized, keep multiple projects on track, and meet numerous deadlines. Often times, I would be presented with a delay from editorial, a dilemna from design, and a demand from production—and needed to quickly come up with solutions. As I grew into this position, I realized I wanted more creativity inmy day-to-day and felt a gravitational pull towards product design</p>
          <p>After mustering up some courage, I enrolled in a UX/UI Design and Frontend Immersive bootcamp with Bloc/Thinkful. What I appreciate msot about this field is that no product carries the same design solution. There isn't a calculated formula one most folllow. Each design outcome is based on the user, their reactions and responses, and analyzing the research you discover. It's up to the designer to uncover those truths and create a successful experience.</p>

          <div class="Community-Outreach">
            <h1>Community Outreach</h1>
            <p>An outlet that also lends itself to UX/UI design is volunteer work. For the last 6 years, I've worked closely with elementary schools and nonprofit organizations. I've mentored students as young as 7-years-old in social studies, and taught English classes for adults well into their late 70's.</p>
            <p>On a personal note, I enjoy listening to people, hearing their concerns, and providing them with a sounding board. With Product Design, it enables me to delve deep into the minds of the users and ascertain their needs.</p>

              <figcaption>On Tuesday afternoons, I went to PS 3 and tutored reading and writing to 4th graders. It was the best way to spend a lunch break!</figcaption>

            <div class="Why-Design?">
              <h1>Why Design?</h1>
              <p>Immigrating to the United States, observing other cultures and their unique designs, helping others be it professionally or personally have all led me to a career in Product Design. This rewarding profession combines the curiosity I have to understand others and to empathize with their needs, while creating an experience that works. It all begins with asking thoughtful questions and understanding the why behind it.</p>
