        <h1>A bit about me</h1>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>I was born in Venezuela and moved to the United States when I was 5-years-old. From walking down city blocks lined with locals selling arepas, to driving down the New Jersey turnpike for the very first time, it was an adjustment. I remember arriving at Newark airport unable to process the cold weather. What is this strange sensation?</p>
        <p>However, adapting to a new culture and learning to speak English has led me to be curious about the rest of the world. <b>What I find most rewarding is observing another country's design aesthetic.</b> How does their stop sign differ from the one back home? What colors and shapes do they use for their buildings? Why are their storefronts decorated that way? <b>What is their design and why?</b></p>

          <h1>Before Design</h1>
<<<<<<< HEAD
          <p>For the last 7 years, I've been a project manager at Penguin Random House. In order to be successful in this role, one must be well-organized, keep multiple projects on track, and meet numerous deadlines. Often times, I am presented with a delay from editorial, a dilemna from design, and a demand from production—and need to quickly come up with solutions. <b>As I grew into this position, I realized I wanted more creativity in my day-to-day and felt a gravitational pull towards product design.</b></p>
          <p>After mustering up some courage, I enrolled in a UX/UI Design and Frontend Immersive bootcamp with Bloc/Thinkful. What I appreciate msot about this field is that no product carries the same design solution. There isn't a calculated formula one most folllow. Each design outcome is based on the user, their reactions and responses, and analyzing the research you discover. <b>It's up to the designer to uncover those truths and create a successful experience.</b></p>
          </div>
          <div class="Community-Outreach">
            <h1>Community Outreach</h1>
            <p>An outlet that also lends itself to product design is volunteer work. For the last 6 years, I've worked closely with elementary schools and nonprofit organizations. I've mentored students as young as 7-years-old in social studies, and taught English classes for adults well into their late 70's.</p>
            <p>On a personal note, I enjoy listening to people, hearing their concerns, and providing them with a sounding board. <b>With product design, it enables me to delve deep into the minds of the users and ascertain their needs.</b></p>
