        <div class="Problem">
          <h1>Problem</h1>
          <p>Through a comprehensive survey, 100% of participants confirmed they use cloud storage, but 25% of those users don't understand how cloud storage works or what purpose it serves. They know they need it, but don't know why they need it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Solution">
          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>Build a conceptual model, in this case a cubby, that would store all of their content. By doing so, it provides users with a visual of where their belongings are located.</p>
          <p>When uploading or creating content, users are prompted to save their items in a designed cubby. Types of cubbies users could have include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recipes</li>
            <li>Photos</li>
            <li>Drafts</li>
            <li>Records</li>
            <li>Docs.</li>
            <li>PDFs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="User-Research">
          <h1>User Research</h1>
          <p>I began with a user survey, polling participants between the ages of 18-74, living in cities as well as suburbs. I quickly found that whether it's for professional or personal use, or both—cloud storage is a needed and important service.</p>
          <h4>Core customer needs:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy to share content with others</li>
            <li>More storage space on hard drive</li>
            <li>Content is backed up</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Areas to improve:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of organization</li>
            <li>Price if too high</li>
            <li>Don't understand how it works</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="User-Analysis-Findings">
            <h1>User Analysis Findings</h1>
            <p>From the survey analysis and phone interviews, I concluded that the product needed to be straightforward, organized, and affordable. with so many  cloud storage services out there, how could I make this one stand out? I decided to target a specific group: those who consider themselves "non-tech" and need a service that is easy to understand.</p>
            <p>"It's not intuitive for older users and often isn't explained well."</p>
            <p>—Peter, 54 years old, Providence</p>
            <p>"I should know more about cloud storage, but it goes way over my head."</p>
            <p>—Amelia, 32 years old, Queens</p>
            <p>"I let my IT gui at work handle it. Seems too complicated, I don't have the patience."</p>
            <p>—Mary, 28 years old, Boston</p>

          <div class="Competitive-Analysis">
            <h1>Competitve Analysis</h1>
            <p>I took a deeper look at my competitors and conducted a competitive analysis. I studied 3 top services that specialize in cloud storage:</p>
            <img src=""/>
            <p>Google Drive has over 1 billion people registered and offers the most amount of storage space for free. You have access to Google Docs and Sheets, and quick links to Google Maps and Youtube. But with so many users, the chances of being hacked are high.</p>
            <img src="">
            <p>DropBox is one of the original leading cloud storage providers. This product knows how to do one thing very well and has brand name recognition. But it provides the lowest amount of storage space for free.</p>
            <img src=""/>
            <p>Box offers an unlimited number of users working on the same cloud, and has managing and monitoring tools. However, it better serves those in a business environment as opposed to an individual.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Personas">
            <h1>Personas</h1>
            <p>Based off of my user survey and follow-up phone interviews, I created a couple of personas highlighting certain themes that were prevalent.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="User-Stories">
            <h1>User Stories</h1>
            <p>From analyzing data and interviews, I created user stories to reflect the top needs. This was a helpful exercise showcasing what features were deemed necessary. What remaind now was a simple and understandable design that would faciliate these tasks.</p>
            <h4>Top priorities</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Saving & uploading content</li>
              <li>Creating & organizing content</li>
              <li>Sharing & collaborating content<li>
            </ul>
            </div>
          <div class="User-Flows">
            <h1>User Flows</h1>
            <p>The visual design process began with sketching basic user flows. What would the onboarding experience look like? How could the user view content? What was invovled in sharing content> I wanted there to be helpful steps so the user didn't feel lost, but I also wanted to be mindful of cognitive overload. The goal was to strike a balance between clear, easy prompts but not to overwhelm the user.</p>

            <div class="Wireframes">
              <h1>Wireframes</h1>
              <p>Once I had my user flow sketches and site map ironed out, I began to sketch wireframes. I knew I wanted a cubby visual on the landing page and on the main dashboard, but it was still unclear how that would look. Would the cubbies be side-by-side, or would they be spaced out?</p>
              <p>As for the content, I intended it to be thoughtful and engaging but not overbearing. The user should feel supported and guided, but not bothered by the assistance.</p>

                <img src=''/>

              </figure>
              <div class="Prototypes">
                <p>From my wireframes, I created clickable prototypes and tested them on 3 individuals. The feedback I received was that the design layout was comprehendible, the content engaging—however the participants felt the cubby design was distracting and too pronounced. I still want to keep this visual model, but knew I had to tone it down and simplify it, in order to be effective.</p>

                  <h1>Helpful Feedback</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The exclamation point was meant to be seen as an "important item" but instead folks thought there was an error with uploading the file.</li>
                    <li>Users didn't need multiple "switch to work" functions, they felt that one was sufficient.</li>
                    <li>There was confusion on how to organize or filter a cubby. Questions arose—could you color code them, could you flag them, what kind of order would they be in?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="Prototype-Observations">
                    <h1>Prototype Observations</h1>
                    <p>It was exciting to see cubby take shape and become a tool for people to use! Testers liked the concept, but the visual element needed work. I learned that one of the most important features: organization, was lacking. Participants asked thoughtful questions about organization that I had failed to consider. I needed to go back to the drawing board and address those concerns.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="Branding-&-Style-Guide">
                    <h1> Branding & Style Guide</h1>
                    <p>When I first began working on this project, I thought about items that could hold multiple things. Initially the idea of a shelf with books came to mind. I wondered if those items could symbolize items you would have on your cloud storage space.</p>
                    <h5>Early sketches</h5>
                    <figure>
                      <img src=''>
                      <figcaption>The main response was that there was too much detail and to simplify the logo.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                      <img src=''>
                      <h5>Second round of sketches</h5>
                      <figcaption>My focus was to turn to the actual name, cubby. Could the image of a cubby be enough to convey the brand?</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>While fine-tuning my logo, I began to establish the color palette. My goal was for the user to have a calming and emotional response. Organizing content whether on a device or physically in front of you, can be an overwhelming and daunting task. I wanted to the colors to be warm and inviting, encouraging the user to take their time and enjoy the site.</p>
                    <p>I tested early mockups using the color black for text, but instead opted for a darker grey to lighten the page. The background is the color white to keep the site simple and clean. As for fonts, I chose SF Pro Rounded semibold as the primary text, and Open Sans as the secondary text. I wanted the style and brand of cubby to carry a feeling of fun and welcoming.</p>
                    <div class="Final-Logo">
                      <h1>Final Logo</h1>
                      <img src=''>
                    </div>
                    <div class="Hi-Fi-Mockups">
                      <h1>Hi-Fi Mockups</h1>
                      <p>There were 5 rounds of Hi-Fi screen testing. I created and piloted these clickable mockups using Figma. Due to COVID-19, testing was done over FaceTime.</p>
                      <figure>
                        <img src=''>
                        <figcaption>Hi-Fi of the landing page. Through multiple rounds of testing, the color blue changed and the cubbies that appear in the hero image, took on different colors. The floating sheet of paper cascades on the page adding a fun element. Ideally, I would like the paper to be moving slightly to give the landing page some animation.</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <figure>
                        <img src=''>
                        <figcaption>Once the user has logged in, they can choose whether they'd like to see their home or work dashboard. In this case, we're viewing a home dashboard. Each cubby has an image of what's inside: the file type, the number of files, a screenshot of the file, and when it was last viewed.</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <figure>
                        <img src=''>
                        <figcaption>These are the different filter options, helping the user stay organized.</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <figure>
                        <img src=''>
                        <figcaption>In this example, the user has created a "Chocolate chip cookies" Word document. This message asks if they would like to store in an existing cubby or give it it's own cubby. The purpose was to avoid feeling like content is thrown into a disorganized filing cabinet.</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <figure>
                        <img src=''>
                        <figcaption>The graph that appears informs the user how much storage space is available and what it's being consumed by. At the bottom, the user can see what their current plan is and the option to upgrade.</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <div class="Conclusion">
                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>If I had more time and resources, I'd continue testing and iterating over the minimum viable product (MVP). I would have liked to add animatoin to the homepage, and allow the user to color code different cubbies.</p>
                        <p>The biggest lesson I learned was never to assume what your user knows. Because 100% of participants use cloud storage, I assumed they knew what it was and how it worked. Going into this project, I never thought this would be something to consider and address. Survey results and interviews are so essential to the design process, that is where your opportunity to grow unveils itself.</p>
